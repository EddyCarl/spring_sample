Pluralsight Spring framework tutorial


Simple tutorial going through the very basic parts of the Spring framework. Also allows me to play around with Git via IntelliJ also so that I can get a better feel for how to use Git/GitHub and the internal IntelliJ VCS menus/hotkeys.

Topics covered:

- Setter/Constructor injection
- Using XML files to define beans and autowire our application
- Using annotations to configure our application (In conjunction with the XML file - Just using it to a lesser extent)
- Using a pure Java implementation where there is no longer an applicationContext.xml file in the project
- Playing with Bean scopes
- Adding properties to beans
