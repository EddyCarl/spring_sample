Pluralsight Spring framework tutorial


Simple tutorial going through the very basic parts of the Spring framework. Also allows me to play around with Git via IntelliJ also so that I can get a better feel for how to use Git/GitHub and the internal IntelliJ VCS menus/hotkeys.

Topics covered:

- Setter/Constructor injection
- Using XML files to define beans and autowire our application
- Using annotations to configure our application (As opposed to XML)
